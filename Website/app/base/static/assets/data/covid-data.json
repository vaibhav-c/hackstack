        "q": "What is COVID-19?",
        "a": "COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective."
      },
      {
        "q": "How does the virus spread?",
        "a": "COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected."
      },
      {
        "q": "What is community spread?",
        "a": "Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your local health departmentâ€™s website."
      },
      {
        "q": "How can I protect myself?",
        "a": "Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
      },
      {
        "q": "What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?",
        "a": "Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately\\n Trouble breathing\\n Persistent pain or pressure in the chest\\n New confusion\\n Inability to wake or stay awake\\n Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone\\n *This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you."

      {
        "q": "Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?",
        "a": "Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. See If You Have Pets for more information about pets and COVID-19."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?",
        "a": "Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets."
      },
      {
        "q": "What is community mitigation?",
        "a": "Community mitigation is a set of actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. The goal of community mitigation in areas with local COVID-19 transmission is to slow its spread and to protect all individuals, especially those at increased risk for severe illness, while minimizing the negative impacts of these strategies. For more information, see Community Mitigation Framework."
